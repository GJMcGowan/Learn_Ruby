## Learn Ruby The Hard Way

This repo was me working through [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/) to learn the basics of ruby.

I completed through to section 26, learning about:

* Data types (strings, arrays, hashes etc.)
* Reading and writing to files
* Methods, classes, argument
* Booleans && if/else statements
